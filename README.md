# The Quizgame

## Introduktion
This is a command-line game created with python for my Project portfolio 3 at Code Institute, Full-stack development program. 

The game is structured in 3 levels. If you pass the first level, you move on to the next, if you don't, you get more attempts. At the end, your results are compiled and saved to a google worksheet. The result is also printed out in the end of the game. So the player is able to se the results aswell.

## User Stories 
* As a creator, I want to:
1. Build an easy app with python.
2. Build an app that is structered and easy to follow. 
3. Build an app that is easy but challenging. 

* As a visitor, i want to:
1. Enter the game with my name.
2. Be able to understand how to play the game. 
3. Be able to see my results so i can develop next time i play. 

## Design
* I have not imporded any colorama for colors since there where no time left for me to do that. But is it something to add to develop the app further in the feature. 
* The design thinking i did was that i clear the terminal when move to next levels. I think it looks less messy and the app is easier to follow.
